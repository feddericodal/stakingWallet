create a fullstack application with solidity, hardhat, rainbowkit, react

I wrote this application to practice with solidity, I did not pay much attention to the graphical aspect because I wanted to focus more on the technical aspects such as writing smart contracts, writing tests to verify that the contract was working properly, and making the best use of calls from javaScript to the solidity contract.

1) npx hardhat node --> run hardhat network
2) npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost --> deploy contract to network
3)npm start --> start react and the project
